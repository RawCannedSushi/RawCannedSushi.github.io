            <h2>Maize and Blue Athletic Passes For All!</h2><hr> With the arrival of the new sports seasons, the schools <i>Maize and Blue</i> fund has announced athletic passes for all SJHS students. These passes allow current SJHS students to get into any home game for free. Students will not be able to use these to get into away games, and if lost, replacements are $10. Please note these passes only work for the student themselves, not parents or other family members.
            <br>
            <h3>Reasoning</h3> The school has seen dwindling attendance numbers to sports of all kinds for years now (including football). The lack of student support has lowered team morale, and the school hopes that students will attend more games with the new athletic pass in hand.<br> The school also believes that this may be a wise <i>economic</i> decision as well. That the new passes may encourage students whole families to come see games since the students get in free. This leaves the parents and siblings still stuck buying tickets.
